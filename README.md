# kingCountryHouses
 In this dataset we have to predict the sales price of houses in King County, Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. Before doing anything we should first know about the dataset what it contains what are its features and what is the structure of data.
For your first Machine Learning project, you’ll build a regression model to predict house prices based on their characteristics. Please follow the steps below:
1. Load the dataset.
2. Explore the data to understand its structure — features, target variable, shape, and data types.
3. Clean the dataset (handle duplicates, missing values, etc.).
4. Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y).
5. Explore correlations between the target and features, and among features. Include your interpretations.
6. Handle categorical variables (encoding).
7. Train baseline models such as Linear Regression and KNN Regressor.
8. Evaluate the models using metrics like R² and MSE.
9. Improve your models:
  - Data side: handle outliers, multicollinearity, feature selection, normalization/standardization, feature engineering, etc.
  - Model side: try other models (especially ensemble methods) and perform hyperparameter tuning.
10. Compare all models and select the best one.
11. Identify which features most strongly influence house prices based on your best model.
